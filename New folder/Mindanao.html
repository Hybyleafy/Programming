            <h2>Dinagat Islands</h2>
            <p>
                Found in the northeasternmost part of Mindanao is a group of islands called Dinagat Islands. This emerging attraction, although relatively more underrated versus its now popular adjacent island Siargao, is home to tons of interesting spots that are brought about by nature. This part of Surigao del Norte has some of the most 
                impressive secluded beaches, caves, waterfalls, and mountains.
                One is Lake Bababu, which contains both saltwater and freshwater and has a
                 650-meter-long and 2,200-meter-deep underwater cave that connects divers from 
                 the lake to the open sea. To relax, you might want to lounge at Bitaog Beach and Cabacungan Cove. 
                 Other famous islands in this group are Pangabangan Island, with a tidal pool and blue lagoon, and Hagakhak 
                 Island, with astonishing rock formations.

            <h2>Daku Island</h2>
            <p>Mindanao is known for its coasts, so we’re starting the list with one of the most gorgeous beaches in the region. 
                Located in the surfing capital, Siargao, this island beauty boasts powdery white sands and turquoise waves right
                 out of your summer dreams.Daku is often compared to Boracay, but what makes it an ideal beach getaway is that it 
                 isn't flocked by tourist crowds. 
                You can reach the island via an island-hopping tour with its neighboring islets Naked and Guyam islands.

            <h2>Asik-Asik Falls</h2>
            <p>Another breathtaking waterfall is located in North Cotabato. It springs water from huge rocks and lush 
                vegetation—an unusual thing as most falls have a river or stream above its towering walls.It’s no easy 
                feat getting here as it will take an hour-and-a-half bumpy motorbike ride, 
                plus trekking up 376 stone steps. You'll be rewarded when you reach it though—the adventure is worth it!

            <h2>Gordon College</h2>
            <p>
                Gordon College, formerly known as Olongapo City Colleges, is a public educational institution established in 1999. The school is supervised by the City Government of Olongapo. The said college started out as a training center that helps workers in developing skills necessary for employment at the former United States Naval Base. When the facility closed down, it was later converted into a degree-granting institution. 

                Gordon College offers tertiary level programs. Degrees in the fields of Education, Nursing, Customs Administration, Accountancy, and Communication are open to 
                students who 
                are interested to pursue their education in the institution.

            <h2>Hanging Coffins Of Sagada</h2>
            <p>THE PEOPLE OF SAGADA FOLLOW a unique burial ritual. The elderly carve their own coffins out of hollowed logs. If they are too weak or ill, their families prepare their coffins instead. The dead are placed inside 
                their coffins (sometimes breaking their bones in the process of fitting them in), and the coffins are brought to a cave for burial.Instead of being placed into the ground, the coffins are hung either inside the caves or on the face of the cliffs, 
                near the hanging coffins of their ancestors. The Sagada people have been practicing such burials for over 2,000 years, 
                and some of the coffins 
                are well over a century old. Eventually the coffins deteriorate and fall from their precarious positions.
                The reason the coffins were hung was due to the belief that the higher the dead were placed, 
                the greater chance of their spirits reaching a higher nature in the afterlife. Many of the locations of the 
                coffins are difficult to reach (and obviously should be left alone out of respect), but can be appreciated from afar.

            <h2>Sumaging Cave</h2>
            <p>The exhilarating Sumaging Cave, or Big Cave, is the most popular of Sagada's caves. Its immense 
                chambers are home to other-0worldly rock formations with fanciful names such as 'King's Curtain' and the more literal 
                'Cauliflower'. You’ll need a guide (P500) to tour the cave (roughly two hours); the guide will provide a gas lantern.
                It’s quite slippery in parts and you’ll get wet; wear river sandals or other shoes with nonslip soles. It's a 45-minute 
                walk south of Sagada. 
                The Cave Connection adventure ends here.

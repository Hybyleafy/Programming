            <h2>Siquijor: The Enigmatizing Island</h2>
            <p>
                Siquijor, sometimes referred to as the “Island of Fire,” 
                is home to rich cultural traditions tinged with mysticism in addition to 
                immaculate beaches. Discover the ethereal side of the Philippines by seeing traditional healers at 
                work in their age-old profession, visiting healing wells, and seeing enchanted Balete trees. 
                Siquijor is a singular place where cultural mystique and natural beauty coexist.

            <h2>AGUINID FALLS</h2>
            <p>Cebu Island in the Philippines is home to some of the most breathtaking, 
                milky blue waterfalls in the world. While Kawasan Falls is easily the 
                most famous in the region, it definitely has some competition. 
                Aguinid Falls on Cebu Island is probably our favourite waterfall in the Philippines. 
                The Tangbo River cascades down 8 different levels and the electric blue colour has to be seen 
                to be believed. Not to mention, this beautiful waterfall does not see the same crowds as Kawasan, 
                providing a peaceful, off the beaten path experience.

            <h2>Tumalog Falls</h2>
            <p>Tumalog falls on Cebu Island is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the Philippines. 
                The turquoise waters of the falls aren’t quite as vibrant as at Kawasan falls, but the sheer size of the waterfall 
                makes it an incredible place to visit. Due to the somewhat remote location of Tumalog falls in South Cebu it was 
                only discovered in 2012, but thankfully the waterfall is now easily accessible by road. 
                It’s a great place to adventure to as part of a day trip discovering the amazing waterfalls of South Cebu. 
                Two of the other waterfalls worth visiting on the island are Aguinid falls and Kawasan falls.
